1) Implement communication between multiple instances of Matlab or Python over a TCP/IP network.
Consider achieving this both with and without using the TCP and IP functions from Matlab's Instrument Control Toolbox.

2) On the client side, perform signal processing tasks such as QPSK and 16QAM signal generation and the addition of AWGN.
On the server side, perform digital demodulation to evaluate bit error performance.
